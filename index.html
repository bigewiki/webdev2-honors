        <h1>Migrating WordPress</h1>
        <p>
          The beauty of using WordPress as your Content Management System (CMS)
          is that it's open-source, the base software is free, and you have the
          freedom to do almost anything with it. A major benefit of using
          WordPress, or another open-source CMS, such as Joomla, Drupal, or
          Magento, is that, since it’s not proprietary to the hosting platform,
          the site can be transferred at will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Migrating your first WordPress site can be a challenge. There’s a lot
          that can go wrong, even if you’ve done everything right. My goal, as a
          professional migration specialist, is to arm you with the knowledge
          you need to attempt your own WordPress migration. It’s not that hard
          once you understand the basics.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re somewhat seasoned and want to take your migration game to
          the next level, I hope to give you some guidance on what tools and
          methods are at your disposal.

              <p>
                My name is Edward, I've got four years experience on a team that
                migrates hundreds of websites a month, most of them WordPress.
                I've run the team as the technical lead and since passing the
                baton have moved on to develop tools, automation, and reporting
                that continue supporting migrations.

                Beginners should take some time to understand the basic
                structure of their WordPress site, DNS, what to expect during
                migration, and how to preview their site before it goes live.
                I'll also introduce some easy-to-use plugins that make the
                effort simpler and less painful.

                If you already know the basics, are acquainted, or want to learn
                File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and some of the slightly more
                advanced interfaces in your hosting control panel this is the
                place to start. I’ll go over the basics of how to use the
                intermediate level tools to migrate you WordPress website.

                If you're familiar with the Linux command-line interface (CLI)
                and your host gives you secure-shell (SSH) access this is the
                place to start. In order to quickly, easily, and reliably
                migrate and configure sites professionally we employ
                command-line scripts and functions and live inside our
                terminals. Here, I can share what utilities we use and how you
                can use them too.
