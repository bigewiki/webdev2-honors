              <h2>FTP</h2>
              <p>
                File Transfer Protocol, or FTP, is the primary method for moving
                files between remote servers and your local environment. If
                you’re a bit more technically inclined then this is a great
                method for copying your files. If you haven’t migrated a site
                before or if it’s been a while check out my (((Things to Know
                LINK))) section for some information you should know before
                starting your migration.
              </p>
              <p>
                Doing an FTP transfer requires having some sort of client or
                program. The most popular choice is FileZilla, though you could
                consider alternatives such as CyberDuck, WinSCP, Transmit, or
                Free FTP. WP Beginner has a great

                  >article</a
                >
                that compares these clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most FTP clients work by connecting to a remote server, which
                you’ll need settings for. Your web host should be able to
                provide you the settings you need and tell you what path to find
                your files in. Always favor the secure connection, known as SFTP
                or FTPs, for added peace of mind. Once you’re connected you’ll
                use the program to copy your website files down to your local
                machine, be wary of the file paths where you’re copying files to
                and from. This could take a while, depending on the size of your
                site, your connection, and the quality of the server.

          <p>
            Once you’ve copied the files locally you’ll need to upload them to
            the destination server. You’ll need another set of FTP settings to
            connect to the destination server before this upload can begin.
            Another prerequisite is that you understand where your files need to
            go on the so you drop them in the right place. Your web hosting
            support team should be able to assist with this if you need help.

              <h2>PHPMyAdmin</h2>
              <p>
                A good portion of large web hosts use a platform called cPanel,
                which includes everything you need to use your web hosting
                account. One of the tools included is called PHPMyAdmin, a
                database administration application with access to your
                WordPress database.
              </p>
              <p>
                Assuming you’ve already downloaded your WordPress files you
                should have a file called wp-config.php. If you open it up it
                will have 4 lines of code with your DB_NAME, DB_USER,
                DB_PASSWORD, and DB_HOST. These lines represent your database
                connection strings and will, likely, need to be updated after
                creating a new database on the destination server. For now,
                we’re only concerned with the DB_NAME, which, as you might’ve
                guessed, represents the name of your WordPress database.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside of PHPMyAdmin on the source account, on the left, you’ll
                see a list of all the databases that your instance of PHPMyAdmin
                has access to. Be careful not to change anything while you’re in
                here, there’s a lot that can go wrong if you’re not careful.
                Select your database on the left, you should see the WordPress
                tables appear on the right. At the top, find the tab that says
                export. Most current versions of PHPMyAdmin will have a ‘quick’
                option here that lets you walk away with a complete database
                backup that is downloaded to your computer.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            On the destination end you can, once again, use PHPMyAdmin to import
            the database by selecting the database on the left then clicking the
            import tab at the top. You can use the UI there to select the .sql
            or .sql.gz database backup file and import it to its new home.
            Before doing so make sure you’ve created the new database and are
            importing your database backup into an empty database. When you’re
            creating a new database make note of the name of the database and
            the username/password that connects to it. You’ll have to update
            these values accordingly, as previously mentioned, in the
            wp-config.php on the destination side. Stay aware of what files
            you’re editing and where. Accidently updating the config file on the
            source could bring down your website.

              <p>
                If you have a lightweight WordPress site and your web host uses
                cPanel, you can use File Manager to create a zip or tar file of
                your WordPress site. This could be a bit easier and quicker than
                connecting through FTP. You can also use File Manager to upload
                and unzip/untar your WordPress backup on the destination,
                assuming that File Manager is available.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most modern versions of cPanel also include a backup utility
                that you can use to easily get a backup of a specific database.
                File backups are usually available as well but include way more
                than you need.
