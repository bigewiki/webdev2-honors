            <h2 id="link1">How I Got Here</h2>
            <p>
              Thank you for visiting my site! I’m Edward, I work at a web
              hosting company and specialize in website migrations. I started,
              first, taking tech support calls before making my way into a tier
              2 technical position supporting virtual and dedicated private web
              servers. Here I learned a lot more about Linux before I was pulled
              to work with support teams skilled in WordPress. My interest and
              investment in programming and web development grew as I learned
              Javascript and Bash Shell Scripting. During this time I found my
              calling and knew I wanted to someday become a developer. After a
              couple failed interview attempts I finally got promoted to join a
              Professional Services team and have spent most of my tenure
              running the team as the lead.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the next couple years with Professional Services I took the
              opportunity to apply my knowledge to create scripts and tools to
              simplify and automate our workflow. I built a database and API to
              support tracking and reporting and fed that data into a dashboard
              that served to replace the old spreadsheets that measured our
              productivity previously.
            </p>

                <p>
                  As my progression toward becoming a developer started to
                  stagnate I began taking my education more seriously. I
                  transitioned from being completely self-taught to taking on
                  course work at Maricopa Community Colleges. I started at
                  Gateway before moving on to Mesa, but will finish my degree in
                  Scottsdale as they have the degree program I’ve had my eye on.
                  In the meantime I’m fortunate enough to have the opportunity
                  to apply what I’ve learned in my field.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After creating another internal application that guided sales
                  and support through qualifying and quoting our service I
                  started to gain some recognition for my efforts and got the
                  chance to work on a larger initiative to build a system that
                  would serve our customers. For the past several months I’ve
                  had the humbling experience of working with an engineering
                  team to make this all a reality. I’ve learned a lot but have
                  much further to go. I wholeheartedly believe that “the more
                  you learn, the less you know”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’m an avid supporter of WordPress and attend WordCamp, the
                  conferences hosted in most major cities, annually. Shown in
                  the image are the iconic WordPress lanyards they give out with
                  the passes at each event. I wanted to build a site about
                  something that I would consider myself an expert in, WordPress
                  migrations would tick that box.

              If I was available for freelance without risk of 'conflict of

              migration project. Fortunately the form won't work, feel free to
              submit it anyways.
