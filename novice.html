          <h2>Things to Know</h2>
          <h3>Don’t Bring Down Your Site</h3>
          <p>
            Anyone who hasn’t done a migration before should consider a few
            things. First, and most importantly, never alter files or databases
            on the source (the original server). The source version of your
            website should, ideally, stay online during your migration. If your
            web hosting subscription is running out and aren’t certain you have
            enough time to complete your migration end-to-end, consider
            extending your hosting. A proper migration copies files and
            databases, consider this procedure as more of a clone and less of a
            move. That being said you should always keep a backup of your site
            through one means or another, especially during migration but also a
            best practice. A lot of the plugins I mention below handle making
            backups and there are a lot of great backup plugins that are free!
          </p>
          <p>
            You haven’t botched a migration unless you’ve brought down or broken
            your live website. If your business or livelihood depends on your
            site having minimal downtime, please take extra care during this
            transition. Bringing down your website could also affect your SEO in
            a negative way.
          </p>
          <h3>DNS and Domains</h3>
          <p>
            Next, a word on DNS and domains. Before and during a migration it’s
            not a good idea to update DNS or start a domain transfer to your new
            host. You may accidentally bring down your website and/or email by
            doing so unless your migration is already complete. If you aren’t
            sure what DNS is or how yours works talk to your web hosting support
            team. In short, DNS is the mechanism that directs internet traffic
            to your web hosting server when they type your domain into their
            browser. Once your migration is done then DNS will need to be
            updated, reach out to your support team if you need direction.

          <h3>Anatomy of a WordPress Site</h3>
          <p>
            All WordPress sites are made of two major parts: the website files
            and the database. In the document root of your WordPress site is a
            configuration file named wp-config.php which contains the database
            connection strings that will need to be updated on the new server.
            If you’re using a plugin you won’t likely need to touch this file.
            Also inside your document root are three main directories or folders
            that WordPress needs. The first, and most important to you, is the
            wp-content folder, which has your uploads (media), plugins, and
            themes. The second and third are part of the WordPress core:
            wp-includes and wp-admin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The WordPress database is likely (((BOLD the most important part)))
            of your WordPress site, other than your uploads. The database holds
            all the things that make your site unique, including all your page
            content. The WordPress database is composed of several tables,
            though you may not need to worry about what’s inside as much as
            everything being there during the migration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider your website a paperweight if you only have the files
            without the database or visa-versa. Some of the WordPress files can
            be replaced, advanced migration methods allow you to only migrate
            what’s necessary and replace the rest. For the novice migrator,
            consider all your files important and your database as critical.
          </p>
          <h3>Previewing the Migrated Version</h3>
          <p>
            Because we’ve taken extra care to ensure our website stays online
            during this transition you may find it difficult to preview the site
            on the new server. With WordPress, there are two reliable ways to do
            this: updating the hosts file on your computer or setting your WP
            site on a temporary URL. Both have their pros and cons.
          </p>
          <p>
            On Windows, Mac, and Linux, within your system files, there is a
            particular file we’re interested in called the hosts file. Using
            this file you can override where your computer resolves to find a
            specified hostname, such as a domain. Altering system files is
            dangerous business so always grab an original copy and understand
            how to put it back to how you found it. Just like if you were to
            take something apart with the intention of putting it back together;
            keep track of what screws and bolts went where, how the parts came
            off, and how to put them back. Check out this
            <a
              href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/"

            from How-To Geek for a more in-depth walkthrough on updating your
            hosts file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Updating to a temporary URL is a second option but should only be
            considered if there’s something, such as SSL issues, that prevent
            you from using the hosts file method above. As always, keep a backup
            of your database and understand how to recover if you make a
            mistake, this should be considered more dangerous than the hosts
            file method unless you know what you’re doing. Sometimes all that’s
            required is that you set your site_url and home_url values within
            the options table of your database, but more likely there are
            references to your original URL littered throughout your database.

              target="_blank"
              >article</a
            >
            from WPBeginner for an easy method. If you’re comfortable with the
            command line you could also use the
            <a

              >WP CLI search-replace</a
            >
            utility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reiterating, once again, updating your hosts file is the best way to
            preview your site before it goes live on the new server. An
            alternative, which isn’t 100% but works fairly well, is
            <a href="https://hosts.cx/" target="_blank">hosts.cx</a>. You give
            it an IP and a domain and that’s really it! Some links may be broken
            in the preview that would otherwise work under normal circumstances.

          <h2>Plugins</h2>
          <p>
            For most WordPress users, especially those with little experience
            with migrations, using a plugin is a great solution to make this
            quick and simple. Most of these plugins work by exporting your site
            on the ‘source’ and importing on the ‘destination’. Be aware that
            while plugins are simpler to use there are limitations on how big
            your site can be, even if these limits aren’t advertised. Large
            sites will commonly timeout during an import or export. In some
            cases, the better plugins can handle larger sites by breaking the
            site up into multiple packages, but this is commonly a premium
            feature. You can see the top migration plugins listed on the

              If you’re not sure about migrating your own website and need help,
              consider your options. A lot of web hosts have tools and support
              for new customers migrating their website to them, this could make
              the process easy and give you a comfortable safety net. A lot of
              hosts offer a migration service, sometimes this service is even
              free for new and upgrading customers. If you have no other choice
              you can check out

              hire a freelancer. Be careful with trusting third parties to
              migrate your site, particularly since you need to give them some
